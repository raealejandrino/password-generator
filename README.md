In this repository, you can find a <a href="https://raealejandrino.github.io/password-generator/">live</a> url deployment of a working password generator. Upon visitng the web address, you can click the **"Generate Password"** button and be prompted on criteria for which you'd like your password to fall under. Whether that'd include **lowercase** or **uppercase** letters, **numbers**, or even **special characters**, this generator can create a strong password for your security.
